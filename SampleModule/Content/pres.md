#### <font color="cornflowerblue">So what's the problem?</font>

Notes:
Proprietary software is a con
Like most proprietary systems, it tends to lead you toward their way of doing things
Things get extremely frustrating when you want to do something diferent. 
Then there are the limited list of supported formats for a range of multi-media  

---

#### <font color="cornflowerblue">Ok, and what's the solution?</font>

Notes:
The solution is to use free and open source framework
Frameworks that compliment the open source content management system used in the school
Frameworks that can open up new levels of interactivity in presentations

#### <font color="cornflowerblue">Frameworks such as?</font>

<font color="orange">**RevealJS**</font> A HTML-based presentation framework 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<font color="lime">**Katex**</font> Math typesetting similar to Latex, but built specifically for the web. 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<font color="hotpink">**p5js**</font> A graphics library that provides easy to the HTML5 canvas
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<font color="red">**Plotly**</font> A JS based version of the well known Python library for interactive graphing  
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
<font color="yellow">**Csound**</font> A web-based version of the popular audio programming language - for when WebAudio based libraries isn't up to the task...

#### <font color="cornflowerblue">Can we see some example?</font>

Certainly. 

Notes:
The following are a selection of the slides from various modules I've thought in the past year or two. 
All content is hosting as a website directly within the student's Moodle homepage where the students can interact directly with the content

The following is from <font color="orange">Properties of Sound</font> a first year module on the B.A. in Audio and Music Production.

#### <font color="#9c2131">Loudness perception</font>

<img src="imgs/vu.gif" style="background:#fff;width:60%" />

The seminal work on loudness perception was done by <font color="orange">Fletcher</font> and <font color="orange">Munson</font> at Bell Laboratories, and reported in 1933. Since that time, many refinements have been made. 

The result of all of this was the development of so-called equal loudness contours.

In their experiments they ask a number of people to match a signal ascending upwards in frequency, with that of a steady tone at 1Kz, at a fixed amplitude. 

The results are shown in the following graph.
